# SQL
Learning Structured Query Language


## Methods

- Check if an expression returns NULL
```console
    IFNULL(<expression>,<alternate_value>)
```

- Limit the number of results printed on firing a given query
```console
    LIMIT <offset>,<values_taken>
```
- Find the difference between two dates
```console
    DATEDIFF(<first_date>,<second_date>)
```

- Match a Regular Expression or REGEX 
```console
    LIKE <regular_expression>
```

- Concatenate the results of a query into a single row
```console
    GROUP_CONCAT(<query_returning_multiple_row_values>)
```

- Find the unique or distinct values across all the rows of a column 
```console
    DISTINCT <column_name>
```

- Group multiple similar rows of a particular column
```console
    GROUP BY <column_name>
```

- Order the output by ascending or descending order on firing a given query
```console
    ORDER BY <column_name> DESC 
```

- Specify conditions to query rows from a table 
```console
    WHERE <conditions>
```

- Specify conditions to query groups from a table, after GROUP BY has been applied 
```console
    HAVING <conditions>
```

- Extract a substring. 1-based indexing is followed in MySQL
```console
    SUBSTR(<string>,<beginning_index>,<number_of_characters_to_be_extracted>)
    SUBSTR(<string>,<beginning_index>)              
```

- Concatenate strings and varchars
```console
    CONCAT(<first_substring>,<second_substring>)
```

- Change to upper case
```console 
    UPPER(<string>)
```

- Change to lower case
```console
    LOWER(<string>)
```
